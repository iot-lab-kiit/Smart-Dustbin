# smart_trash
A smart dustbin that can open its lid automatically and send its location when it’s full. This project was inspired by the need to reduce waste and improve sanitation in urban areas. I used an Arduino board, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and a GPS module to create this dustbin. The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of trash and triggers the servo motor to open the lid. The GPS module sends the coordinates of the dustbin to a web server when it reaches a certain level of fullness. This way, the waste management authorities can easily locate and collect the trash. I learned a lot from this project and I’m proud of how it turned out.
