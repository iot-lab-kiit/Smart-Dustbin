Your smart dustbin project is a creative and practical solution to address waste management and sanitation issues in urban areas. Here's an elaboration on the components and functionality of your project:

Components Used:

    Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04): These sensors play a crucial role in detecting the presence of trash in the dustbin. Ultrasonic waves are emitted, and the sensor measures the time it takes for the waves to bounce back after hitting an object. This data is used to determine the distance between the sensor and the trash inside the bin.

    Servo Motor (SG-90): The servo motor is responsible for opening the lid of the dustbin automatically when the ultrasonic sensor detects that it's full. It provides precise control over the lid's movement.

    Arduino UNO: The Arduino board acts as the central processing unit for your project. It receives input from the ultrasonic sensor, controls the servo motor, and communicates with other components.

    Arduino Shield: This is likely used for easy connections and added features. Shields can extend the capabilities of an Arduino board and make the wiring and connections more manageable.

Functionality:

    Trash Detection: The ultrasonic sensors constantly monitor the level of trash inside the dustbin. When the level of trash reaches a certain threshold, the Arduino receives this information from the sensors.

    Lid Automation: Upon detecting that the dustbin is full, the Arduino activates the servo motor. The servo motor's rotation mechanism is used to open the lid automatically, allowing users to dispose of their trash without touching the dustbin.

    Data Transmission: Your initial idea was to use a GPS module to send the coordinates of the dustbin to a web server when it's full. However, you mentioned that the location of the dustbin is usually fixed, and using a GPS module might not be cost-efficient. Instead, you can transmit this data using Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or other communication methods based on the specific location and infrastructure available.

    Remote Monitoring: The data sent to the web server can be accessed by waste management authorities. They can use this information to track the status of the dustbins in real-time. When a dustbin is full, they can easily locate it and schedule timely collections, improving overall waste management efficiency.

By automating trash disposal and enabling remote monitoring, your project contributes to waste reduction and sanitation improvement in urban areas. It's a practical and innovative solution that showcases the power of technology in addressing real-world challenges.
